# Installer Essential Packages and Utilities

This script automatically installs all essential and utility packages for Linux


2 versions,

## Basic version that installs only the minimum:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlessandroMagl/Scripts/main/Installer-Packages/installer-packages-linux.sh && chmod +x installer-packages-linux.sh && ./installer-packages-linux.sh
```
## Ultra version also installs additional things:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlessandroMagl/Scripts/main/Installer-Packages/installer-packages-linux-ultra.sh && chmod +x installer-packages-linux-ultra.sh && ./installer-packages-linux-ultra.sh
```
If these commands don't work you can try running this command first and then try running one of the other two again

```bash
apt install wget
```
